# Creating-a-user-in-Microsoft-365
In this lab we are going to create a user in Microsoft 365 using the  Microsoft 365 admin center

To start we need to start a trial to do this navigate here <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-business-standard-one-month-trial">here</a>

I've already signed up for the trial but you will click on start trial where the sign in now link is.

You will need a credit/debit card for this trial but you can cancel before the month is up so you are not charged.

Once you are done filling out your information you can navigate to the admin center as seen above.

I have found I prefer the dashboard view so I will click on the downward arrow next to simplified view 

Then you can select Dashboard View

Now lets create a user

Clickk on the add user button at the center middle of the screen

Now we can fill out our new users information

The username will be their email associated with their account.

Now lets click next

Now we can select the users locations as well as what licenses we want to give them. For this trial we have 1 license to select from and we can see we only have 24 licenses left to our users

Lets give our new user Joe a Microsoft 365 Business Standard license

You can now see after giving the user one of our licenses we only have 23 left

Click next

  Now we see optional settings

  If you click the down arrow for Roles you can scroll through all the roles we can give our users

Since we don't want this user to have any administration abilities we will leave him as a User (no admin center access)

Below that if you click on the Profile info bottom arrow you will see we can fill out more information about our user

Since this isn't an actual person we will skip that
